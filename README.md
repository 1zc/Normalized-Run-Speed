# Normalized Run Speed

Normalize your players run speed across all weapons!  
This is recommended for bhop/surf servers, so players will have the same run speed, regardless of weapon. This is well paired with `sv_accelerate_use_weapon_speed 0`.

# Dependencies:

DHooks

# This is a Work In Progress

This was only released in an unfinished state due to an incomplete, unpolished version getting shared, despite my wishes.

# To-Do:

- Add convar for maximum customizable run speed (currently hardcoded to 260 u/s)
- Add convar for entirely enabling/disabling plugin

# Credits

Shavit for the method, SM9 for help years ago with this.
